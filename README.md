# Introduction to NumPy

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook introducing **NumPy**, a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing.

## ðŸ“Œ What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source library that allows you to perform:
- Fast and efficient array computations
- Mathematical and logical operations on arrays
- Linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered in the Notebook

- What is NumPy and why use it?
- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Boolean indexing and masking
- Mathematical operations
- Submatrix extraction

  
## ðŸ’¡ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

If you're running this locally, install NumPy using:

bash
```
pip install numpy
```
